How to launch the simulation:


Step 1: Retrieving the project from GitHub

1. Make sure you have Git installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from the official Git website (https://git-scm.com/).

2. Open a terminal on your machine and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the Godot project.

3. Use the following command to clone the project from GitHub:

git clone https://github.com/haroun-k/PlanetSimulation.git

Git will then clone the project from GitHub and download it to your machine.



Step 2: Importing the project into Godot

1. Open Godot and make sure you are using version 4.0 or newer of the Godot engine.

2. In the Godot project manager, click on "Import" in the top right corner of the window.

3. In the popup window that appears, navigate to the directory where you cloned the project from GitHub and select the file "project/ProjetComplet/project.godot".

4. Click "Open" to import the project into Godot.



Step 3: Launching the project execution

1. Wait for the files to be reimported by Godot. Then press the F5 key or click on the "Run Project" button (represented by a white triangle) in the top right corner of the editor window to launch the execution of your Godot project.

2. You should now see your Godot project running in the game window of Godot.

(If you are asked to select a main scene, you should select the file MainScene.tscn in the "Scenes" directory of the project.)
